### JavaScript Drum Kit' exercise from [Wes Bos's free JavaScript30 course.](https://javascript30.com/)

This exercise is a vanilla JavaScript implementation of a simple drum kit that accepts keyboard input and plays an associated sound.  The keydown events are trapped and the sounds are associated in the DOM using a data-key attribute.

Uses the rarely seen `<kbd>` element.

The results is a simple but fun to play with!
